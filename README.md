# Stocks+ iPhone App

## About Open Source of App
Opened source in 2021 from an old zip I made on 26/11/2015. Code is from ca 2012. Roughly app version 1.1
Frontend is all early iPhone (iPhone 4 era)
Backend is all python for google app engine. This was all new to be at the time, so the code is likely atrocious.
